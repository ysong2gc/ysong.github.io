Adjunct Lecturer at CUNY York College as part of my duties as a PhD student at CUNY GC. Awarded the CUNY GC Award for Excellence in Teaching in 2020 to "recognize the work that our doctoral students contribute to CUNY through their teaching on the campuses, as well as your own distinction as an exemplary teacher". I developed a zero-cost, open-access syllabus for Introductory Astronomy Lab (ASTR141), learn more about it [here](https://astronomy141.commons.gc.cuny.edu/).
